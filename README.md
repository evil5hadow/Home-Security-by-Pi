# Introduction
The goal of this project is to make a secure (or at least secure within a reasonable amount of effort) Raspberry Pi with the following network-features: Pi-Hole DNS-resolver, DNSSEC, DHCP, and OpenVPN-server. It is possible that by gaining new insights features are either removed or added.

My other goal is to gain a good understanding on DNS, Hardening and other Security-related aspects concerning Network Security. I feel that as a Lead Information Security Officer it is important to upkeep (general) knowledge about Technology.

# The Scope
Scope is an important part for this project. Otherwise you can endlessly install security tools and solutions which in the end have a trade-off. This might be resources and performance, but also your own precious time to keep it running :).

The constraints are:
- Apart from OpenVPN, there is nothing that can be reached from the outside world. I always assume that there is a network-firewall present between the Internet, and the actual Pi.
- The networking-services this device delivers are meant to enhance security of other network-connected devices in a non-intrusive manner.
- And although this device delivers services in a (reasonable) secure way, it is not meant to be a device that delivers security services by it self, such as network-scanning and vulnerability scans.
- It is meant for home or small-office use. Larger companies or institutions should look at other solutions to protect their people.

# The Hardware
The hardware I use exists of the following components:
- Raspberry Pi 3 Model B 1GB
- SDHC card Class 10 - 16GB
- Pi-Blox Case for Raspberry Pi - Black

The costs: ~ â‚¬ 70,-

**How it looks :)**

# Word of thanks
A special word of thanks goes to Jacob Salmela with his up-to-date [manual](http://users.telenet.be/MySQLplaylist/pi-hole.pdf) (PDF). This guide is inspired on his, although I go a step further in terms of features. Nevertheless, his contribution to (not only) this guide is worth my sincere gratitude. Thanks!
