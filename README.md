# Secure-my-Pi
Description on how I configured the installation and Security of my Raspberry Pi and how I keep it fit for use and purpose.

## Goal
The goal of this project is to make a secure (or at least as secure as reasonable possible) Raspberry Pi with the following features: Pi-Hole DNS-resolver, OpenVPN-server, and DNSCrypt. It is for sure possible that by gaining new insights features are either removed or added.

My other goal is to gain a good understanding on DNS, Hardening and other Security-related aspects concerning Network Security. I feel that as a Chief Information Security Officer it is important to upkeep (general) knowledge about Technology.

Anything that I create is all done under MIT-license, so please do use it as you see fit. In regard to software created under other licences, those do not change and you need to check them for yourself.
